// what  is backtracking?
// 1.  Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems,
// 2.  Backtracking is an algorithmic paradigm that tries different solutions until it finds a solution that  works.

// 3. Discard finned solutions and try again until a solution is found.
// 4. check all possible solutions until a solution is found.
