// What is a binary tree?
//***********************************************************************************
// A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.


// The time complexity of binary tree operations is O(h) time.
// and insertion and deletion is O(h) time.

//in worst case the height of the tree can be n.
// so the time complexity of binary tree operations is O(n) time.
// and insertion and deletion is O(n) time.

// two types of traversal in binary tree (bfs and dfs)
// bfs - level order traversal
// dfs - preorder, inorder, postorder traversal
