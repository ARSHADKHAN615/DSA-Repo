// in stl,have two types of maps
// 1. map and it is sorted, and it is implemented using red black tree, and time complexity is O(logn) for insertion and search and deletion.
// 2. unordered_map and it is not sorted, and it is implemented using hash table, and time complexity is O(1) on average and O(n) in worst case (when collision occurs) and it is implemented using hash table.
